* org-contacts2vcard

This is a Python script that converts [[http://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#org-contacts][org-contacts]] contact information
of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][GNU Emacs]] with [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] to Android 4.4 contact [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard][VCard]] import format.

*Update 2020-10-20*: I am still using this code to export my Org-contacts to my
Android mobile phone (running Android 9). The reason why I wrote "version 4.4"
above maybe was related to changes to the Android VCard format with version
4.4. I can't remember.

- *target group*: users of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] org-contacts who want to get their
  contact information to Android including:
  - First name
  - Last name
  - email addresses
  - phone numbers
  - user images
    - Note: the way contact images are referred to is personalized for
      me (see below). Therefore, you have to adopt either the script
      to your needs or you adopt my image method to your Org-mode :-)

** Customizations: org-contacts

My org-contacts-template is more elaborated than the one in
[[http://orgmode.org/w/?p%3Dorg-mode.git%3Ba%3Dblob_plain%3Bf%3Dcontrib/lisp/org-contacts.el%3Bhb%3DHEAD][org-contacts.el]]. For example, I am using three separated properties
for addresses (CITY, POSTALCODE, STREET) instead of one. If you are
using different properties for certain entries, you might want to
customize in your set-up.

As an example, here are my customizations:
: (require 'org-contacts)
: (custom-set-variables
:  '(org-contacts-files "~/share/all/org-mode/contacts.org")
:  '(org-contacts-address-property "CITY")
:  '(org-contacts-birthday-property "BORN")
:  '(org-contacts-icon-property "PHOTOGRAPH")
:  )

You can have a look on [[https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs][my current Emacs configuration on github]].

** Example

Please take a look at the example org-contact file
[[https://github.com/novoid/org-contacts2vcard/blob/master/testdata/testcontacts.org][testdata/testcontacts.org]]

The file [[https://github.com/novoid/org-contacts2vcard/blob/master/example_invocation.sh][example_invocation.sh]] gives you some impression on how to
invoke this script.

** Contact Images

In [[https://github.com/novoid/org-contacts2vcard/blob/master/testdata/testcontacts.org][testdata/testcontacts.org]] you will notice contact photographs are
included like this:

: :PHOTOGRAPH: [[photo:FirstnameLastname.jpeg]]

~photo:~ is a [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Adding-hyperlink-types][custom link]] which is defined in [[https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs/blob/master/org-mode.el][my org-mode
configuration file]]:

: (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
:       '(
: [...]
:         ("photo" . "file:~/people/all_photographs/%s")
: [...]
:         ))

As you can see, I linked it to files in the folder
~$HOME/people/all_photographs~.

If you use a similar definition, you are able to use my script without
changes.
